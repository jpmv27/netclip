# if you have a crypto crippled JVM, because you are a terrorist,
# you might get a message like this one:
#
#    java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size
#
# This means america has decided you're a terrorist and are therefore
# not allowed to use 256 bit keys. Please turn yourself in at the
# department of homeland security, the NSA or whatever you think is
# appropriate. 
#
# Or you know, just set this value to 128 if you can live with shitty
# crypto. Or just uninstall that oracle adware jvm and install
# openjdk (http://openjdk.java.net/)
